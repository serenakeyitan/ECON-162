### Society and Culture
* Early Chinese cities were associated with ruling clans ruled by kinship, with internal hierarchy.
* Clan chief linked to Emperor
* Kinship and hierarchy more developed than class or caste
* Confucianist philosophy, developed during Zhou dynasty (Spring and Autumn period), formalized many of the existing cultural norms: filial piety, hierarchy within family and society, duties of sons, fathers, emperors. Importance of benevolence and rites. Optimism that humans can be good and be improved. Nobility of virtue instead of food
#### Confucianist philosophy
Confucianist philosophy forms collectivist culture:
- Humans are social beings defined in relation to others;
- The world is stable but individuals are infinitely malleable (changeable)
- Prestige is associated to how well one adapts to society
#### Legalism
- Qin dynasty (221-206BC) propagated legalism: "rule by law" instead of "rule of law"
- Law used to submit people to the Emperor and the state. Lists of strict punishments for particular behaviors. Valid for ordinary people, but also at court
- Chinese history has oscillated between Confucianism and legalism, often relying on both
- Anti-Confucianism. Burnt Confucianist books, executed Confucianism philosophers

If everyone is good Confucianism, society should be fine which does not need too much centralized governance power
Mao is anti-Confucianism since it is too conservative. He is legalism

### Meritocracy - Exam System
- A very important institution was the Imperial exam system as recruitment tool for bureaucrats
- Started in Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD220), was generalized in Tang dynasty (618-907) and existed until abolished in 1905
- Assured competence and merit in promotion. Key element in quality of government administration
- Content of exams ***fostered conservative thinking***: ppl who won exams are good at remembering old books. They are more conservative. 


### Key Elements of state organization
- Starting from the Qin Dynasty, subnational government officials were designed by Emperor as a tool of strategic control over the territory
- Because of distance and bad communications, they had a lot of autonomy, which necessitated self-contained administrative structures
- Central administrative developments were replicated at the local level

Central Adm function & Local governance (replication): Personnel, Finance, Justice, Industry
