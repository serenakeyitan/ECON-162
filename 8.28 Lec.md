## Electromagnetic Wave
Waves that are created as a result of vibrations between an electric field and a magnetic field

## Greenhouse Effect

#### Moon
Some of the Incoming shortwave solar radiation will reflect back on the moon surface. Some will be absorbed. 

*(counted in Watts)*
* 342 total radiation (shortwave)
* 24 radiation that reflected (shortwave)
* 318 radiation that absorbed by Moon
* 318 outgoing (Longwave) Radiation, radiated by surface

#### Earth

different surfaces will have different percentage of diffused reflected sunlight
* snow ≥ 80% of lights will be reflected back
* Sand ≥ 40% of lights
* Ice ≥ 35% of lights

*(counted in Watts)*
* 342 total radiation (shortwave)
* 77 radiation that reflected by atomosphere, cloudsm and aerosols (shortwave)
* 67 radiation that absorbed by atmosphere
* 168 radiation that absorbed by surface
* 30 radiation reflected by surface
* 492 radiated by surface
* 452 Radiated into the atmosphere
* 40 Outgoing longwave radiation form surface
* 195 Outgoing longwave radiation from atmosphere and clouds
* GREEN HOUSE EFFECT
* 324 Back Radiation from Atmosphere abosrbed by surface
**Therefore, Average Temperature on Earth is 40 Celsius**

## Atmospheric Composition
**Major Gas**
* 78.08% Nitrogen 
* 20.95% Oxygen

**Trace Gas**
* Carbon Dioxide 0.038% -> huge effect on greenhouse effect

**Other Trace Element:**
* Water Vapor: 0.25%

Percentage contribution to greenhouse effect


### Radiative Forcing
* "Radiative forcing is what happens when the amount of energy that enters the Earth's atmosphere is different from the amount of energy that leaves it" (MIT Climate Portal)
* **Positive forcing** = more energy is coming in than going out
* **Negative forcing** = more energy is leaving the Earth's atmosphere than is coming in
