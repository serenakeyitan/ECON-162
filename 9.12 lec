#### Nature of the Socialist System

- Three fundamental features:
  - Communist Party in power, enshrined in the Constitution 
  - Dominant public ownership, state ownership
  - Central planning as the main mechanism of resource allocation
- The 3 features are common in all centrally planned economics
  - Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba, etc



#### 1. The Party-State

- Monopoly of power
  - controls every aspect of society
  - Controls everyone in society
- The party's jurisdictions
  - Personnel (appointment, promotion, dismissal)
  - Ideology and propaganda (all media)
  - Mass organizations (union, students, women, etc)
  - Major decisions of the government (5 yr plan, etc)
- The Governments juridictions
  - Formulating plans
  - Implementing plans
  - Control over property, finance, prices, etc -> for counting purpose



#### 2. Public Ownership

- Property rights
  - Rights to the income grenrated by the use of property
  - Rights of use of the property
  - Rights of transfer of the property
- Distinction between two types of property
  - Means of production for producing  products or services
  - Personal property: for personal use
- Distinction between 2 types of ownership
  - public vs private
  - State vs non-state
- State Ownership => ownership of people, state represents people
  - Highest form of public ownership
  - Normally, ownership belongs to the "whole people"
  - The government exercises all the rigths
    - Incomes go to the state budget
    - Government bureaucrats decide how to use property
    - Government bureaucrats decide how to transfer property
  - Collective and cooperative ownership
    - Lower form of public ownership
    - Nominally ownership belongs to a group of people
    - In reality, local government control and intervention



#### 3. Central Planing

- Government control over investment
  - Five yr plan and annual plan determine investment priorities
  - Also decide on specific investment projects (large investment projects approved by Politburo)
  - **All the necessary resources are allocated to the "key projects" such as funds, labor, foreign exchange, etc**
  - A politicized process, not just for economic objectives
  - **"Resource mobilization economy", like "war economy" ** => allocating resources and command and coordination of goods
- Price determination
  - Prices set by government, not to equate supply and demand
  - Basic principle: prices reflect the social necessary costs (excluding land and capital) and prices should be stable
  - Price policy serves the purpose of 
    - channeling funds to the government
    - Income redistribution

- Price distortion patterns

  - Low prices for consumer basic needs (food, rent, health care, etc) and raw materials

  - High prices for manufactured goods and luxury goods

  - Low factor prices (wages, interest rates, exchange rates)



- Production Plan: material balances

  - An output target for each producer

  - A supply plan that transfers resources between producers

  - A schedule of usage coefficient linking inputs and outputs

    => you(manager) are told whom to buy and who to sell and how much to produce

    bc government has to coordinate all the goods

- The input-output problem

  - How to disaggregate the plan
  - The problem of information
  - A huge number of bureaucrats involved
  - Feasible plan is possible, but not efficient plan

- **Material Science SHEET** 

  Supply 1                          |Demand 1

  Supply 2                          |Demand 2

  ...                                       |...

  SUM OF SUPPLIES       |SUM OF DEMANDS

=> in reality, they are not equal

=> input output table, invented by 19th

=> not much care for enterprise manager to minize the cost

- Incentives of managers under central planning
  - if plan target is "total number of nails", tiny nails will be produced to maximize the number
  - if plan target is "total weight of nails", one huge nail will be produced to maximize the weight
  - Managers also bargain with the planner to lower output quotas and to raise inputs supplies(buffer supplies)
- Similarity and differences between managers under central planning and in public corporations 
  - They all have "incentive problems": conflict of interests
  - Incentives are different, however.

##### Market vs Central

=> In market economics, overproduction is accumulative(outputs are high, inputs are low); 

=> In central economic, shortage is accumulative(inputs are high, outputs are low = a lot of accumulation behavior)
